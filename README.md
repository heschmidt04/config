# Config repo orign 

The config repo came from from wanting a shared location for much of the set up of my Macintosh setup 

From there it has evolved with the following software to make my life much more extensible and not reinvent the wheel with tools that are easily installed and add flexibility 

| [TextExpander -- expanding macros instead of aliases in env files everywhere ](https://textexpander.com/)|
| [HomeBrew -- package management and package extensibility for tools on Macintosh computers ](https://brew.sh/)|
| [1Pass -- centralized secure passwords for all the devices ](https://1password.com/)|
| [ZSH -- flexible shell that has extensible pre configured environments in Antigen](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH)|
| [Antigen -- typical setup for things that matter most like Python toml/pipenv's per "MichaelAquilina/zsh-autoswitch-virtualenv" ](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen)|
